Notes:
- All data points extracted using plotdigitizer.com/app and so may not be
identical to the actual measurements in the paper. They should be pretty close,
however. This also explains the insane number of "significant" figures (I've
just copy-pasted what plotdigitizer gives you).
- Data from Fig. 3.
- On small scales the error bars are imperceptibly small on the plots, so have
been assigned an error of zero. This will obviously cause problems if you
try to use this data in a fit! Beware.
