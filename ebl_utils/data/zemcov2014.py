Notes:
- On masking: "The extended 2MASS catalog is 75% complete at J=17.5,
which translates to 17.5 and 17.0 in CIBER’s 1.1μm and 1.6μm bands,
respectively,and all fields are masked to this depth."
- The 3.6 micron measurements here are from Spitzer, the same as presented in
Cooray+ 2012, but with a shallower masking threshold closer to CIBER.
