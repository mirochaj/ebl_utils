Notes:
- Power spectrum measurements in Table SI 1.
- Reported in nW m^-2 sr^-1, here we square for consistency with other datasets.
- Masking is done with the Spitzer Wide Deep Survey (Ashby et al. 2009; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...701..428A/abstract),
so the `masking_depth` attribute contains the limiting magnitudes at 3.5 and 4.6
microns from that paper. This work says sources from the NOAO Wide-field
Survey are also masked (Januzzi & Dey 1999; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ASPC..191..111J/abstract).
That survey is quite a bit deeper, BRI >= 26 AB mag, JH = 21 AB mag, and K = 21.4 AB mag.
